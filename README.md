Fun website, by that one [Rusted Moss](https://www.rustedmossgame.com/) modder. [Hosts some cools stuff](https://harlem512.github.io/). Powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/), the coolest framework I've used.

# RM Interactive Map

[![name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harlem512/rm-map/refs/heads/main/tiles/1/0/0.png)](https://harlem512.github.io/rm-map.html)

An interactive map for Rusted Moss. Build with LeafletJS, a [fork](https://github.com/commenthol/gdal2tiles-leaflet) of `gdal2tiles.py`, some python scripts, and a RM mod. [Tiles are hosted here](https://github.com/Harlem512/rm-map).

## To Build

You'll need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en). Then run `npm run build`, which creates the `dist` folder. Alternatively, used `npm run dev` or `npm run preview` to locally host a development or production version of the site, respectively.
