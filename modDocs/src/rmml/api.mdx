# Caching

# `global.rmml_map`

# `global.rmml.register`

# Runtime

Most of RMML's code is concerned with populating `global.rmml_map` as quickly as possible. However, something needs to read that map and actually run modded Event code. RMML's runtime has [changed](/rm-docs/rmml/changelog) [drastically](/rm-docs/rmml/design#rmml-runtime-history) between versions, so let's go over the latest.

Rusted Moss runs modded Event code using Events that look like this.

```gml
// gml_Object_omod_controller_Create_0
// check if the function exists
if ds_map_exists(global.mod_map, "controller_events_create")
{
  // ensure `self` gets set to this Game Object
  ds_map_find_value(global.mod_map, "controller_events_create").setSelf(self)
  // call the stored function
  ds_map_find_value(global.mod_map, "controller_events_create")()
}
```

Each Event has its own key, based on the Game Object and Event names. `global.mod_map` is a `ds_map`, and maps these event keys to Catspeak function calls.
