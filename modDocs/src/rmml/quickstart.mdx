# Paid Shill

Throughout this documentation, there have been a lot of references to Rusted Moss Mod Loader (RMML). RMML is a tool created by me to aid in my personal modding journey (not that it can't be used by others), and its design is heavily influenced by its [history](/rm-docs/rmml/history). I highly recommend using it, or building [something similar](/rm-docs/mose/mods#globalmod_map), if you are going to do serious modding.

This article contains detail on how to install RMML and the basics for making mods with it.

# Install

RMML is available on the [rm-mod-manager](https://github.com/Harlem512/rm-mod-manager/releases) Github page. Download the latest release's `rmml_{VERSION}.zip` file, and unzip it into the Steam `mods` folder, replacing `meta_info.ini`.

<FileTree
  basePath="mods"
  paths={[
    'rmml/rmml.meow',
    'rmml/rmmm.md',
    'asset_list.ini',
    'constant_list.ini',
    'function_list.ini',
    'meta_info.ini',
    'method_list.ini',
    'modlist.txt',
    'rmml.ini',
    'sniper_bnuy.ini',
  ]}
  highlightString='{7-11,5}'
/>

You can write mods using the "standard" `.ini` syntax or RMML's `.md` syntax (or [`index.csv`](/rm-docs/rmml/advanced#indexcsv)). Mods written with RMML installed should be placed in the `mods/rmml` folder and enabled with Rusted Moss Mod Manager in-game, or added to the [modlist](#modlisttxt).

<CodeTable
  caption="INI Mod VS RMML Mod"
  languages={['mini', 'rmml']}
  entries={[
    [
      "[object_list]\ncontroller = enabled\ninstance = enabled\n[controller_events]\ncreate='show_message(\"Foo\")'\nroom_start='show_message(\"Bar\")'\n[instance_events]\ncreate='self.y += self.vsp; self.vsp *= 0.5; if self.vsp < 0.1 { instance_destroy(self) }'",
      '# controller\n## create\n```\nshow_message("Foo")\n```\n\n## room_start\n```\nshow_message("Bar")\n```\n\n# instance\n## create\n```\nself.y += self.vsp\nself.vsp *= 0.5\nif self.vsp < 0.1 {\n  instance_destroy(self)\n}\n```',
    ],
  ]}
/>

RMML also uses the save folder for storing logs and other information. If you're using Rusted Moss Mod Manager (which comes installed with RMML), any mods you download are also in that folder. On Windows, this is `%LocalAppData%/RustedMoss`. For more information about how RMML works, see [the full article.](/rm-docs/modding/rmml)

# Rusted Moss Mod Manager

RMML comes installed with Rusted Moss Mod Manager (RMMM). This mod lets you download mods off the [internet](https://github.com/Harlem512/rm-mod-database), manage your mod installation, and adds safety features.

# `modlist.txt`

RMML completely bypasses Rusted Moss's mod loading when loading other mods, and doesn't read the mod list in `meta_info.ini`. Instead, the file `modlist.txt` in the `mods` directory stores a list of mods to load.

```
# put your mods here (or disable them with #)
# mods are loaded (and run) in the order written here
rmml_modlister.md
ccw_shark.md
cc_shark.md

my_mod_here.md
my_other_mod.ini
your_mod_folder/mod_name.md
```

If you're using RMMM, this file is located in the [saves folder](/rm-docs/gml/architecture#folders) instead of the Steam folder. If you're using RMMM, I recommend ignoring this file, and using RMMM to manage your mods in-game instead.
