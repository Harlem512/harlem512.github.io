# The Discord

Most mods are stored in the [official Discord](https://www.rustedmossgame.com) in the `# mod-share` channel or in the [`rm-mod-database`](https://github.com/Harlem512/rm-mod-database) Github repository. Many mods reference RMML or Rusted Moss Mod Loader, which is also available in the `# mod-share` channel or [on Github](https://github.com/Harlem512/rm-mod-manager).

Rusted Moss Mod Loader is required to use `.md` and `index.csv` mods and is optional for `.ini` mods. RMML also comes installed with RMMM, which greatly simplifies installing and managing mods.

# Steam Directory

Mods live in Rusted Moss's Steam directory, `Steam/steamapps/common/Mose`. You can easily find this by right-clicking on the game and clicking "Browse local files".

From here, you'll find the `mods` folder. Some mod installation guides call this folder `Mose/mods`.

From there, you follow the mod's install instructions. For non-RMML mods this usually means unzipping the install zip into the `mods` folder, making sure `meta_info.ini` is replaced.

If an install zip isn't provided, then you need to open the `meta_info.ini` file in the `mods` folder and set `mod_enabled` to `1` and replace `sniper_bnuy.ini` with the file name of the mod.

```mini
[general]
mod_enabled = 1
[meta_info]
mod_0 = my_mod.ini
```

# Rusted Moss Mod Loader

[Rusted Moss Mod Loader (RMML)](/rm-docs/rmml/quickstart) replaces the normal mod installation and loading process to fix [a few issues](/rm-docs/rmml/design#pain-points). RMML comes with Rusted Moss Mod Manager, which lets you download mods from the [internet](https://github.com/Harlem512/rm-mod-database), manage your mod list, and automatically disables mods in the event of startup crash.

RMML downloads are available in the `# mod-share` channel in the [official Discord](https://www.rustedmossgame.com) or [on Github](https://github.com/Harlem512/rm-mod-manager/releases). You install by unzipping `rmml_X_X.zip` into the `mods` folder, replacing `meta_info.ini`. After starting the game, you can use the gear icon on the menu to open the GUI and download other mods.

If you want to install a mod manually, place it in the `mods/rmml` folder (in either the Steam or saves directories) and either enable it with RMMM or add your mod (as a relative path from `mods/rmml`) to [`modlist.txt`](/rm-docs/rmml/quickstart#modlisttxt) in the `mods` folder.

If you are using RMML, ***do not install other `.ini` mods or modify `meta_info.ini`***.
