# Using the `controller` `create` Event for Evil

This mod has an issue. Can you spot it?

````rmml
# controller

## create
```
let inst = instance_create_depth(0,0, 0, omod_instance)
inst.persistent = true
```

# instance

## create
```sp
self.name = "Fern"
```

## step
```sp
-- should print "Fern", but it doesn't do anything ???
show_message(self.name)
```
````

Here's the issue.

```rmml {3}
# controller

## create

...
```

If you make Instances during a `controller`'s `create` Event, the `instance` `create` Event fails to run. To get around this, you can set an Alarm for one frame later, or use the `room_start` Event instead.
