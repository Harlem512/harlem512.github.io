# Engine Overview

GameMaker is event-driven and object-oriented; code exists as [Events](#events), which operate on [Instances](#instances) as defined by their [Game Object](#game-objects). If you're familiar with object-oriented programming, then this will sound familiar: Game Objects are classes, Instances are objects, and Events are special class methods called by the GameMaker engine.

# Game Objects

Game Objects define structure and relationships. They determine what Events are registered and initial Instance variables. Similar "things" can be grouped together for easier code reuse and extension. You can call parent Events using `event_inherited()` and find the parent using `object_get_parent(o)`.

For example, all pickups share a common parent, `par_pickup`. Instead of checking for each pickup type individually, we just check for the parent.

```gml {6}
// gml_Object_oplayer_Step_2.gml
...
if global.trinket_active_[5]
{
  var do_fx_ = false
  if instance_exists(par_pickup)
    do_fx_ = true
  ...
}
...
```

Rusted Moss provides [six](/rm-docs/gml/objects) Game Objects we can easily write Event code for. Our ability to manipulate Game Objects is limited by [boring technical reasons](/rm-docs/modding/limitations#game-object-sadness).

# Instances

Instances are mindless data. They're assigned a Game Object (using `object_index`), which determines their behavior; every Instance of a Game Object runs the same Events. Instances are usually made using `instance_create_depth(...)`. Most Instances are destroyed when a new [Room](#rooms) is loaded, however the `persistent` variable overrides this behavior.

```catspeak
let inst = instance_create_depth(10, 10, 0, omod_instance)
-- `sprite_index` is managed by the engine
inst.sprite_index = splayer_offscreen
-- setting a custom Instance variable
inst.name = "Fern"
```

Some Instance variables are [managed by the engine](https://manual.gamemaker.io/lts/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Instances/Instance_Variables/Instance_Variables.htm) for various functions.

# Events

Events are code, and implement behavior. Most Events happen each frame, in a [specific order](/rm-docs/gml/events#execution-order), but some are called depending on certain conditions, like when a Room is entered or when an Instance is created. Events can be called using the [`event_perform(...)`](https://manual.gamemaker.io/lts/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Objects/Object_Events/event_perform.htm).

```mini
[instance_events]
# `create` event, set name
create = 'self.name = "Maya"'
# `draw` event, draw our name each frame
draw = 'draw_text(0, 0, self.name)'
```

We can only write code for [twenty-five](/rm-docs/gml/events) Events, however most of the classics are moddable. You can check the [official documentation](https://manual.gamemaker.io/lts/en/The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events.htm) for a full list of all Events.

# Rooms

Rooms are collections of Instances, tile map data, and other data. The game is always operating with a loaded Room. Everything that happens inside a Room is isolated and non-persistent, meaning anything that happens to a Room or inside a Room is lost when the Room is unloaded (unless explicitly saved).

In Rusted Moss, most of the time the screen fades to black the current Room is being unloaded and a new Room is being loaded. We also get a visual example of Room behavior: every time the same Room is loaded, enemies are in the same place, tiles are in the same place, money on the ground is gone, etc. If you want persistent Room data, you can use the `room_start` Event with conditional logic based on global variables.

We have a lot of tools to manipulate Rooms through modding, from `room_add(...)` to `room_assign(...)`. Because of [boring technical reasons](/rm-docs/mose/rooms) we can't just use `room_goto(...)` to load Rusted Moss's Rooms.

# Sprites

Sprites are images, and are used to render most things to the screen. Anything that isn't extremely fluidly animated is probably a Sprite. GameMaker gives us a lot of control for manipulated Sprites, however there are [performance issues](/rm-docs/modding/limitations#sprites) if you load too many new sprites.

# Folders

There are three main folders for modding.

| Path                                 | Name         | R/W          | Used For                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Mose` | Steam Folder | Read-only    | RM Files, mods                    |
| `%LocalAppData%\Rusted_Moss`         | Save Folder  | Read/Write   | Changeable files, persistent data |
| `%LocalAppData%\Temp`                | Temp Folder  | Read/Write\* | Temporary files                   |

When reading a file, the game **_first checks the Save folder_** for a matching file, then it checks the Steam folder. The Steam folder forbids writing, so any if you write to file, it always writes to the Save folder.

Reading from or writing to the Temp folder requires prefixing the path with `temp_directory_get()`. Files in the Temp directory can be freely deleted at any time, so you should only use it for temporary files.

# Globals

The global namespace can be accessed using the `global` struct, and contains many persistent data structures and variables, such as Player data (ie `global.ameli_mode_`, `global.hp`, etc), UI state (`global.gamestate`), and other data.

Unlike Instances, which are cleared, **_global variables are not reset_**. This is especially important when using Gamemaker's [data structures](https://manual.gamemaker.io/lts/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Data_Structures/Data_Structures.htm) or loading assets (ie `room_add`, `sprite_add`, etc).
